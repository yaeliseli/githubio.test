Welcome to DHTK's documentation!
================================

In recent years, the digital humanities have received particular
attention from both the humanities community and from computer science.
Scholars working in Digital Humanities research often need to access to
a range of data regarding cultural data.

The Internet is a great source for searching and retrieving this type of
information, and archives such as Project Gutenberg, Europeana,
Archive.org, *and similia*, provide many datasets relevant to the
research scientists. However, many of these resources are organized and
structured in different ways and are often incompatible, having
different APIs and different metadata structures, which make these
repositories difficult to exploit.

In addition, a number of powerful automated methods for analyzing text,
sound, and images have been developed, but these tools are technically
difficult or do not adequately fit the needs of the humanities
community.

As a result, finding resources, checking metadata, and finally
processing cultural data and metadata, can be a long, tedious, and
complex process.

By introducing the Digital Humanities Tool Kit (DHTK), we propose a new
python library whose purpose is to overcome these limitations by
providing an intuitive tool for large-scale study of large cultural
databases, exploiting state-of-the-art computational methods to support
and simplify research in the Digital Humanities.
