# Community

We are proud to say that the DHTK community is growing continuously.
Being created by the researchers of the "Informatique pour les Sciences
Humaines" of the University of Lausanne, the project has seen an
increased interest from both the teachers of other sections and the
students, both from Bachelor and Master programs. DHTK was also
presented at the Second Workshop on Humanities in the Semantic Web
(WHiSeII) co-located with 16th International Semantic Web Conference
(ISWC 2017), held in Vienna, Austria in 2017. Multiple visitors of the
workshop have expressed interest in DHTK and the project was well
received. As such, people from different walks of life from different
parts of the world have already become a part of our community. You can
do so too by contributing to this open source project.
