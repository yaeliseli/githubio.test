- What is DHTK?

DHTK stands for Digital Humanities ToolKit.
Its purpose is to connect two very different disciplines: Humanities and Computer Sciences.
At the moment, DHTK focuses on interacting with the Gutenberg database in tandem with DBpedia to provide access to
literary works and their associated metadata in an easy and intuitive way. However, being modular, we expect DHTK
functionalities to quickly grow and support different areas of research.
